 <h3> About the name</h3>
<p>You shouldnt interpret the title of this website as "A bbs pertaining to php".
Its simply called like that because originally I was wanting to program a framework for making wikis in PHP...
However over time this idea got less and less appealing to me, I realised I wanted to make something more social than a wiki.
Maybe something *inbetween a wiki and a bulletin board*?

While in the end there are many features that a Wiki would have (Everyone can edit pages etc) the initial goal that I had of programming a wiki software from scratch has vanished.

<h4> So what is it all about?</h4>
This project will keep evolving for as long as I can make it evolve, adding new features that may or may not be related to it's original roots as a Wiki software.
For now you can register, make posts and comment on posts.

<h3> Style and emphasis inside posts </h3>

<p>You can use a form of markup to lightly style ypur texts.

<h4> Headers</h4>
<p>For now there is only a single level of heading.
To add one to the page you simply start a line with '##' followed by a mandatory space and then the heading's text.
The whitespace is important otherwise the line gets displayed as-is, and not as a header.
e.g. : ## This is a heading

<h4> Emphasis</h4>
<p>You can use style tags to put emphasis on words or group of words. 
It works on a per-line basis, meaning that each line of your text must contain both a opening and closing tag (Often they are the same token, but sometimes not, as with links).
If your line is missing a tag, the text is displayed as is. The same will happen if you try, for example, to underline a section that spans multiple line. it wont work.
It is meant to provide a simple way to underline single words although if you wish you could apply it to the whole line;
And then do the same for each line, this way you can reach the whole text.

Currently the following are available:
* Italics -> '//'
* Bold -> '**'
* Underline -> '__'

e.g. Consider this line, //this would be italics// and this would be normal.

<h4> Links</h4>
<p>You can link to other posts on the bbs.
However the link's text is always the title of page being linked to.
To insert a link anywhere inside a line, you must enclose the page's title between '-[' and ']-'.
The following example would link to a page named 'my page'.
e.g. : -[my page]-
If there is no page with that name, the line gets *displayed as-is.*

<h2>User stats explained</h2>
<h3>Gratitude</h3>
<p>Gratitude represents the sum of all the votes one user did, so a negative number is not necessarily bad; it just means this user has downvoted more often than he has upvoted.
e.g. a user with 0 gratitude has never voted OR has upvoted as many times as downvoted.
It is useful to find users who spam votes.  </p>
